  Basics:

    ES5 -> Var, ES6 -> Let, Const

    Arrays & Object

    Iteration:
      Array - map, filter, find, findIndex, foreach, reduce
      Object - keys, values, for...in 
        map reference of array elements & array objects

  ES5 vs ES6 ---> Features Of ES6

    Template Literals
    Default Parameters
    Enhanced Object Literals
    Arrow Function
    Object/Array Destructuring
    Rest Spread 

    OOP 
      this, function, class initialization

  Asynchronous Programming
    Callback ---> function passed as param to other
      Modular/Readability/Reusable Codes
    Promise
      Object representation of eventual completion of success/failure of an Asynchronous operation
      states:
        pending
        fufilled
        reject

      accessing values promise
        .then
        .catch
      
      Promise Chaining ---> when then return a promise itself we need to do a .then on top
        .then().then()
      
      Promise.all() ---> Combing Multiple promises into a single which gets fullfilled with all the values of promises and reject if one of the promise has failed

    API ---> Application Programming Interface

      APIs are the communication between services( backend, front-end, payment, ... ) can be using JSON etc...

    State of an application using APIs ---> REST APIs --> representational state transfer

    Fetch -> Interface to make an api call
      then ---> response --> convert response to json -> promsie .then (json -> operation on json)
    
    CRUD --> 
      Read => Fetch
      Create => Fetch with Method POST
      Update => Fetch with Method PUT
      Delete => Fetch with Method DELETE

    async await ---> 
      making a block of statement behave like async along with async operation  
        async {
          const response = await fetch("api-url"); ---> async action
          const json = await response.json(); ---> async action 
          console.log(json); ----> this line waits for the completion above two async actions
        }

    Publice APIs

      Public APIs are the open-source information service in various categories 

      An application utilize those APIs to build an application

      when You need to use a public api
        Know Your requirement
        search for an api
        select an apis with following criteria:
          Use APIs which has HTTPS & CORS --> Cross Origin Resources Sharing enabled
          If Signing is fine Go for Auth, HTTPS, CORS enabled
          CORS -> Cross Origin Resource Sharing
